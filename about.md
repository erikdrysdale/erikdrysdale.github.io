<p> My name is Erik Drysdale and I work as a Senior Data Scientist at Boston Consulting Group GAMMA.  I have an expertise in developing and statistically validating machine models, particularly in a healthcare context. Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Specialist with the <a href="https://aim.sickkids.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI in Medicine initiative (AIM)</a> at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. My research interests also include high-dimensional inference and survival analysis. I have a background in economics and have worked as a housing economist at the Bank of Canada. </p>
