Canada's housing marking is characterized by an affordability crisis. Residential real estate prices have more than tripled in Vancouver and Toronto over the past twenty years. The year of COVID has been a disturbing case in point: both cities have housing price indices ([HPIs](https://www.crea.ca/housing-market-stats/mls-home-price-index/hpi-tool/)) have increased by more 5% (Vancouver) and 11% (Toronto), despite Canada experiencing its [largest contraction of economic activity](https://www.conferenceboard.ca/focus-areas/canadian-economics/canadian-outlook) since the Great Depression (5.3% GDP decline). International organization like the IMF have expressed [concern](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/CR/2020/English/1CANEA2020001.ashx) of "household indebtedness and housing market imbalances", with housing market prices in Toronto and Vancouver above what [fundamentals](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/11/15/Assessing-House-Prices-in-Canada-48777) would justify. The Bank of Canada has also [signaled](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2020/10/from-covid-to-climate-importance-risk-management/) that it sees the federal government as the first line of defense against housing market imbalances, and is therefore unlikely to factor in asset price changes in its interest rate decision making. 

What the future holds for Canada's housing market is in many ways unknowable. What we do know, however, is the economic drivers behind the skyrocketing housing market. Though there is considerable [debate](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/supplymatters/) around which factors are the most important, demand for housing has clearly been stoked by both market forces and policy choices: 

1. Tax benefits (most famously, the exemption of capital gains on the sale of a primary residence)[[^1]]
2. Foreign investment (Canada is seen as a political stable jurisdiction and is especially popular with Chinese investors)
3. Government subsidies (including a literal [equity stake](https://www.placetocallhome.ca/fthbi/first-time-homebuyer-incentive) available from the [CMHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Mortgage_and_Housing_Corporation))[[^2]]
4. Regulations that prevent the development of new housing (i.e. influencing expectations about future supply)
5. Ultra-low mortgage interest rates (5-year fixed [is below 1.5%](https://www.ratehub.ca/historical-mortgage-rates-widget))
6. Existing capital gains in home equity

These strong demand factors are simultaneously interacting with policy-induced supply constraints. Namely, that is illegal to build medium- to high-density housing on the majority of residentially zoned land in Toronto and Vancouver. Oft-cited geographical constraints such as the Pacific Ocean, North Shore mountains, [Agricultural Land Reserve](https://www.alc.gov.bc.ca/alc/content/alr-maps), or the [Green Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenbelt_(Golden_Horseshoe)) are distractions to the real issue. I recently [reviewed](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/house_divided/) *House Divided*, a book which discusses the regulatory reasons behind the "missing" low- to medium-density housing structures that are absent in Toronto. The problem of regulatory constraints is not a Toronto-specific problem. A virtually [identical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjWs7dqaWfY&ab_channel=AboutHere) problem exists in Vancouver. The political economy of Toronto and Vancouver has settled into an equilibrium that is acceptable to wealthy private landholders and developers: high-rise development will occur on a tiny percentage of the land, with the majority of residential land preserving its historic "character". 

While reading this book I noticed a fascinating figure from [Dr. Anna Kramer's](https://www.mcgill.ca/urbanplanning/people-0/prof-kramer) chapter *Inside and Outside: A Meditation on the Yellowbelt*, which showed that a significant portion of Toronto's neighbourhoods had actually lost population since 1971. This is consistent with the Yellowbelt Hypothesis: zoning regulations which prevent natural densification lead to a population decline in neighbourhoods where household sizes shrink naturally overtime (e.g. the children move out, the grandparents pass away).

Disturbed and intrigued by Kramer's figure above, I reached out to learn more about the data. I was pleasantly surprised when Dr. Kramer said she would be able to share the data with me that she had used to generated this figure. In this rest of this post I will provide numerous figures and descriptions of the data that shed light onto how populations have changed within the Toronto and Vancouver Census Metropolitan Areas ([CMA](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92-195-x/2011001/geo/cma-rmr/def-eng.htm)). 

## Terminology and data sources 

The population data is measured at the unit of [dissemination areas](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92-195-x/2011001/geo/da-ad/def-eng.htm) (DAs). DAs are the smallest geographical unit measurement that StatsCan releases to the public. The mean and median DA was 0.13 and 0.85 km^2 in this dataset. Although some DAs can be quite large, such as the relatively uninhabited [Electoral Area A](http://www.metrovancouver.org/services/electoral-area-a/Pages/default.aspx). Unless otherwise noted, "Toronto" and "Vancouver" refer to the CMA (e.g. "City of Toronto"). "Net density" refers to increases (or decreases) in the population that have occurred since the formation of the DA. For example, if DA #12345 was first formed in 1981 with 500 persons, and has 1100 individuals in 2016, its net DA calculation would be 600 over this period. "Net DAs" refers to the population change attributable by the creation (dissolution) of new (existing) DAs. Returning to the previous example, in 1981 that DA would have a net density change of 0, but a net DA change of 500.

Unlike my other posts, I'm not going to show the code needed to recreate this analysis for two reasons. First, most of the code is fairly uninformative and is largely data processing and transformation. Second, I cannot easily upload the datasets needed to recapitulate this analysis. However, if you are interested in getting access to the data contact either myself or Dr. Kramer. For those who are interested in the code, the github repo used to generate these results can be found [here](https://github.com/ErikinBC/DAKramer). I was impressed by the state of support for geographical analysis in `R`, particularly the `sf` package and its seamless interaction with the `tidyverse` and `ggplot` environments. 

The primary source of data was the DA-level data from the census provided by Dr. Kramer. I also made use [Census 2016](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/download-telecharger/comp/page_dl-tc.cfm?Lang=E) DA data, [cartographic boundary files](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm) for plotting purposes, as well as useful [map of Toronto](https://github.com/mylesmharrison/toronto_neighbourhoods) any its neighourhoods, as well as [information](https://geocoder.ca/?register=1&capostal=1) on a mapping between DAs and census subdivisions. 

Lastly I want to make two notes of caution and stress the limitations of this analysis. First, due the adjustments made to the DAs by Statistics Canada to make them comparable over time, there is measurement error in some of my analyses. This means that the aggregated values of the DAs in a given census subdivision, or median income in that DA will be noisy. After doing some visual spotchecks, I am confident that the aggregate errors are likely to be small. Second, because this analysis is necessarily [exploratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), I have almost completely avoided using "p-values" or formal statistics as these methods only make sense in a highly proscribed and pre-specified environment. 

## Executive summary

Because this post contains seventeen figures and numerous technical discussions, I have tried to distill the salient facts which emerge from the analysis. Despite the impressive gains in population, it is clear from analyzing the micro-data that the distribution and composition of neighbourhood growth in the Toronto and Vancouver CMAs leaves a lot to be desired. The clear spatial and geographical concentration of population increases points to obvious regulatory constraints preventing densification on the majority of residential land.

1. The Toronto and Vancouver CMAs have seen their population more than doubled since 1971, outpacing national growth, and adding 3.2 and 1.4 million individuals, respectively.
2. The City of Surrey accounts for the plurality of growth in the CMA: 31%, whereas growth in more balanced between cities within Toronto. 
3. Two-thirds of the Toronto CMAs population growth has come from the creation of new dissemination areas (DAs), whereas increased densities of DAs accounts for only a third. In the Vancouver CMA, the figures are reversed: two-thirds of the population gains have come from increased densities in existing DAs. 
4. Since the 2011 census, very little population growth has come from new DA formation.[[^3]]
5. Toronto's oldest DAs have shown very little densification, whereas DAs formed after 1971 have been more likely to record higher density over time.
6. There is significant population churn in DAs between censuses, with the Toronto and Vancouver CMAs consistently losing 250K and 125K individuals to de-densification. Although the number of DAs which either gain or lose population is similar in number, positive increases in DAs are right-skewed so that net density tends to increase. 
7. There is a clear spatial correlation between where density has increased. Population growth has been concentrated into a fraction of residential areas.
8. **Over a 45 year period, 1971-2016, 56 of Toronto's 140 official neighbourhoods had smaller populations in 2016 than they did in 1971 (e.g. The Annex). More than 70% of neighbourhoods in what was formerly Old Toronto, fall into this category of de-densification. 80% of the City of Toronto's population growth have come from 20 neighbourhoods.**
9. Statistical evidences suggests that having a higher share of row housing units is associated with higher population growth (the "missing middle" hypothesis), whereas higher incomes and single-family and semi-detached homes are associated with a declining population over time ([NIMBY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY) hypothesis).

## (1) Data overview

The Kramer dataset contains 9 censuses, starting in 1971 and going to 2016, with the census occurring every fifth year, except for 1976, which is unavailable. Each file contains the aggregate population for the Toronto and Vancouver CMAs. For example, in 2016 the Toronto CMA was around 5.9 million individuals, with the City of Toronto accounting for a little less than half of this number.[[^4]] The other cities in the Toronto CMA that have a population exceeding 300K are Mississauga, Bramptom, Markham, and Vaughan. This first section will analyze the key challenges and considerations that were used when analyzing the data.

There are a total of 7516 and 3440 unique DAs over all census years for the Toronto and Vancouver CMAs, respectively. While any DAs found between census years in this dataset are consistent in the sense that they correspond to the same geographic boundary, many DAs are unavailable (i.e. missing), for earlier census years because they did not exist at the time.

<center><h3>Figure 2: Number of DAs by census year</h3></center>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/gg_n_DA.png" width="60%"></p>

Figure 2 shows that the number of DAs roughly doubled from 1971 to 2016 in the Vancouver and Toronto CMAs. The main reason for this is that the amount of residential and inhabited land in these cities has been growing over time. As development pressure has increased, industrial parks have been converted into condos and [greenfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_land) sites have been turned in residential communities. 

<center><h3>Figure 3: Churn in DAs</h3></center>
<center><p><img src="/figures/gg_DA_delta.png" width="60%"/></p></center>

DAs can also be "lost" between census years if that area is redeveloped to a non-residential purpose. However, for most of the past 45 years, the ratio of newly created DAs to lost DAs is at least 5:1 as Figure 3 shows. The large increase in neighbourhood formation in Toronto and Vancouver effectively ended in the 2001-2011 period. What are some of examples of DAs that no longer exist? I spot checked the few cases (8) of DAs that no longer had population between the 2011 and 2016 census using Google maps. In one instance the area had become a parking lot and associated commercial buildings, in another, it was a sprawling mall complex (that had grown I presume), and in the third case, a new area of construction in [Regent Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent_Park).[[^5]]

</tr></table>

To better understand the overlap in neighbourhoods over time, the pairwise similarity of DAs between census years can be calculated using the [Jaccard Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), which is the ratio of the intersection over the union.

<center><h3>Figure 5: Jaccard similarity between censuses </h3></center>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/gg_pair.png" width="60%"></p>

With the addition of so many DAs over time in both CMAs, the earlier census years are only comparable for around 60-80% of neighbourhoods. One final data issue to note is that there is a discrepancy between between the aggregate census count of the CMA and the population total over all DAs, especially for the early census years.

<center><h4>Figure 6: Data discrepancies in total population count </h4></center>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/gg_pop_err.png" width="60%"/></p>

The sum of the DAs is slightly less that the total count, ranging from 3% in Vancouver in 1971 to effectively 0% in the two most recent censuses for both cities (Figure 6). I am not sure why there is discrepancy but given its (relatively) small size, it is unlike to impact any of the following analysis.[[^6]]

## (2) Population growth decomposition

Since 1971 the populations of the Toronto and Vancouver CMAs have more than doubled, meaning these cities have led growth in the country of Canada, which has a grown a more modest 63% in this period. From a demographic perspective, two factors influence the size of any city: natural population growth and net migration. I suspect that the latter has accounted for most of these cities population increases. From a geographical lens, population growth can come from either the formation of new neighbourhoods on previously uninhabited sites, or through increased population density on existing land. As Kramer's Figure 1 at the start of this post showed, many neighbourhoods have lost population (i.e. have become less dense). If this is the case, how has the distribution of density gains/losses changed over time? And even if the net density has increased, what is the distribution of this change?

<center><h4>Figure 7: Historical population growth </h4></center>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/gg_pop_hist.png" width="60%"/></p>

Figure 3 showed that from 1971 to 2001 there was significant increases in the number of DAs in both cities. But Figure 7 shows a fairly consistent increases in the population over time. *Prima facie*, this would suggest the initial population increases in Toronto and Vancouver were driven by new neighbourhood formation, whereas the 2001-2016 period would be driven by increasing densification. 

Assuming that missing DAs have a population of zero, then by picking an index year we can see whether the neighbourhoods in that index year, on net, grew over time. Figure 8 below calculates the counterfactual scenario for all index years leading up to 2016.

<center><h4>Figure 8: Counterfactual population growth </h4></center>
<p align="center"><img src="/figures/gg_idx.png" width="70%"/></p>

For most of the census years, the population growth from existing neighbourhoods has been lower than the overall CMA's growth rate. Although there is noticeable timing discrepancy between Toronto and Vancouver in this regard. For Vancouver, as Figure 8 shows, the percentage increase in the population from existing DAs starting is 1996 is roughly equivalent to the overall population growth of the city. In contrast for Toronto, only in 2006 does population growth for existing DAs match the overall population change. Somewhat shockingly, the 3885 DAs measured in Toronto in 1971 have, on net, seen no population growth over than last 45 years!


Next, looking at the actual data we can see how much densification of existing neighbourhoods versus new neighbourhood formation was responsible for the increase in population across populations.

<center><h4>Figure 9: Decomposition of CMA population growth </h4></center>
<table><tr>
<td> <img src="/figures/gg_decompose.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 650px;"/> </td>
<td> <img src="/figures/gg_cf_decomp.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 650px;"/> </td>
</tr></table>

As expected, most of Toronto's population growth until 2006 has been driven by the formation of new housing developments (net DAs), whereas most of the population gains for the Vancouver CMA since 1991 have been through increasing densification of existing DAs. Roughly two-thirds of Toronto's population gains since 1971 have come from net DA formation, whereas Vancouver is the opposite: two-thirds of its growth has come from increased density within DAs and only one-third from new DA formation. Notice that while the composition of population growth has changed, the five-year population increases have been fairly steady at around 400K and 200K for the Toronto and Vancouver CMAs, respectively. This means that the population growth in these areas is actually slowing down, since the denominator is growing but the numerator is roughly constant.

Figure 8 use the term "density" to describe the net increase in population between censuses for those DAs that were found in each respective year.  However, it would have been more accurate to describe this as "net density", since some DAs lost population, whilst others gained. For both CMAs, there is signficantly more variation within DAs than the net figure would suggest.

<center><h4>Figure 10: Population changes within DAs between censuses </h4></center>

    </tr>

Figure 10 reveals some fascinating dynamics within the data. First, the range of population changes is distributionally very similar for both increases as well as decreases in density. Since 2006, there has been a large right-tail for (log) positive changes, implying a small number of neighbourhoods are contributing disproportionately to gains in the population. Every five years, the Toronto and Vancouver CMAs see a loss of (roughly) 250K and 125K people in de-densifying neighbourhoods. Declining populations in DAs puts additional pressure for the intensification of exiting neighbourhoods. In (10C), we see that the number of DAs which experience a gain or loss in population is roughly equivalent, especially for Toronto. Amazingly, there were more DAs which lost population in the 2016 census (relative to the 2011 one) than gained in the Toronto CMA! The fact that net density increase was 250K shows that the DAs which gained must have increased substantially more than the DAs which lost population.

If gains in density are stemming from outsized gains in a handful of neighbourhoods, are these gains spatially concentrated? Figure 11 below shows that this is undoubtedly the case in both the Vancouver and Toronto CMA. What's visually striking about this image is how few DAs have seen a substantial population rise the eponymous cities. Instead, large gains are coming from suburbs like Brampton, Vaughan, and Markham in the Toronto CMA, and Surrey and Coquitlam in the Vancouver CMA.

<center><h4>Figure 11: Geographic concentration of population gains in DAs </h4></center>

Census subdivisions ([CSDs](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92-195-x/2011001/geo/csd-sdr/def-eng.htm)) are StatsCan's geographic unit the aligns with the municipalities that most Canadians are familiar with: Vancouver, City, New Westminster, etc. Population gains on the DA level were spatially correlated both in the sense that nearby DA was more likely to experience if another did, but also in that they aligned with the CSDs within a given CMA.

<center><h4>Figure 12: Gains in population by CSD </h4></center>

    </tr>
</table>

Figure 12 shows how the different CSDs have contributed to their respective CMAs population over time, as well as whether this growth came from density or new developments. CSDs in the Toronto CMA like Mississauga and Bramptom were added most of their population increases through the creation of new DAs. The "Other (Toronto/Vancouver)" refers to the CSDs that lacked sufficient population on their own to be visually distinguishable. This includes areas like Aurora and Ajax in the Toronto CMA or Tsawwassen and West Vancouver in the Vancouver CMA. Mississauga is an interesting case in that it saw substantial population growth over time, mainly through net DAs, but as of 2016 had almost no net population change. Bramptom has an impresseive track record or maintaining a high population growth rate whilst pivoting away from net DAs to net density. 

In the Vancouver CMA, the City of Surrey has led population growth every census period, and has managed to grow substantially from pure net density in the last two censuses. As a result, Surrey has contributed to almost a third (31%) or the Vancouver CMAs total population increase since 1971 (10B).
