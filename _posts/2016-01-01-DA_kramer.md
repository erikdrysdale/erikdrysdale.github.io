Canada's housing marking is characterized by an affordability crisis. Residential real estate prices have more than tripled in Vancouver and Toronto over the past twenty years. The year of COVID has been a disturbing case in point: both cities have housing price indices ([HPIs](https://www.crea.ca/housing-market-stats/mls-home-price-index/hpi-tool/)) have increased by more 5% (Vancouver) and 11% (Toronto), despite Canada experiencing its [largest contraction of economic activity](https://www.conferenceboard.ca/focus-areas/canadian-economics/canadian-outlook) since the Great Depression (5.3% GDP decline). International organization like the IMF have expressed [concern](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/CR/2020/English/1CANEA2020001.ashx) of "household indebtedness and housing market imbalances", with housing market prices in Toronto and Vancouver above what [fundamentals](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/11/15/Assessing-House-Prices-in-Canada-48777) would justify. The Bank of Canada has also [signaled](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2020/10/from-covid-to-climate-importance-risk-management/) that it sees the federal government as the first line of defense against housing market imbalances, and is therefore unlikely to factor in asset price changes in its interest rate decision making. 

What the future holds for Canada's housing market is in many ways unknowable. What we do know, however, is the economic drivers behind the skyrocketing housing market. Though there is considerable [debate](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/supplymatters/) around which factors are the most important, demand for housing has clearly been stoked by both market forces and policy choices: 

1. Tax benefits (most famously, the exemption of capital gains on the sale of a primary residence)[[^1]]

### Footnotes
