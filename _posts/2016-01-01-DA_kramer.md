Canada's housing marking is characterized by an affordability crisis. Residential real estate prices have more than tripled in Vancouver and Toronto over the past twenty years. The year of COVID has been a disturbing case in point: both cities have housing price indices ([HPIs](https://www.crea.ca/housing-market-stats/mls-home-price-index/hpi-tool/)) have increased by more 5% (Vancouver) and 11% (Toronto), despite Canada experiencing its [largest contraction of economic activity](https://www.conferenceboard.ca/focus-areas/canadian-economics/canadian-outlook) since the Great Depression (5.3% GDP decline). International organization like the IMF have expressed [concern](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/CR/2020/English/1CANEA2020001.ashx) of "household indebtedness and housing market imbalances", with housing market prices in Toronto and Vancouver above what [fundamentals](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/11/15/Assessing-House-Prices-in-Canada-48777) would justify. The Bank of Canada has also [signaled](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2020/10/from-covid-to-climate-importance-risk-management/) that it sees the federal government as the first line of defense against housing market imbalances, and is therefore unlikely to factor in asset price changes in its interest rate decision making. 

What the future holds for Canada's housing market is in many ways unknowable. What we do know, however, is the economic drivers behind the skyrocketing housing market. Though there is considerable [debate](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/supplymatters/) around which factors are the most important, demand for housing has clearly been stoked by both market forces and policy choices: 

1. Tax benefits (most famously, the exemption of capital gains on the sale of a primary residence)[[^1]]
2. Foreign investment (Canada is seen as a political stable jurisdiction and is especially popular with Chinese investors)
3. Government subsidies (including a literal [equity stake](https://www.placetocallhome.ca/fthbi/first-time-homebuyer-incentive) available from the [CMHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Mortgage_and_Housing_Corporation))[[^2]]
4. Regulations that prevent the development of new housing (i.e. influencing expectations about future supply)
5. Ultra-low mortgage interest rates (5-year fixed [is below 1.5%](https://www.ratehub.ca/historical-mortgage-rates-widget))
6. Existing capital gains in home equity

These strong demand factors are simultaneously interacting with policy-induced supply constraints. Namely, that is illegal to build medium- to high-density housing on the majority of residentially zoned land in Toronto and Vancouver. Oft-cited geographical constraints such as the Pacific Ocean, North Shore mountains, [Agricultural Land Reserve](https://www.alc.gov.bc.ca/alc/content/alr-maps), or the [Green Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenbelt_(Golden_Horseshoe)) are distractions to the real issue. I recently [reviewed](https://bioeconometrician.github.io/house_divided/) *House Divided*, a book which discusses the regulatory reasons behind the "missing" low- to medium-density housing structures that are absent in Toronto. The problem of regulatory constraints is not a Toronto-specific problem. A virtually [identical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjWs7dqaWfY&ab_channel=AboutHere) problem exists in Vancouver. The political economy of Toronto and Vancouver has settled into an equilibrium that is acceptable to wealthy private landholders and developers: high-rise development will occur on a tiny percentage of the land, with the majority of residential land preserving its historic "character". 

While reading this book I noticed a fascinating figure from [Dr. Anna Kramer's](https://www.mcgill.ca/urbanplanning/people-0/prof-kramer) chapter *Inside and Outside: A Meditation on the Yellowbelt*, which showed that a significant portion of Toronto's neighbourhoods had actually lost population since 1971. This is consistent with the Yellowbelt Hypothesis: zoning regulations which prevent natural densification lead to a population decline in neighbourhoods where household sizes shrink naturally overtime (e.g. the children move out, the grandparents pass away).

Disturbed and intrigued by Kramer's figure above, I reached out to learn more about the data. I was pleasantly surprised when Dr. Kramer said she would be able to share the data with me that she had used to generated this figure. In this rest of this post I will provide numerous figures and descriptions of the data that shed light onto how populations have changed within the Toronto and Vancouver Census Metropolitan Areas ([CMA](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/92-195-x/2011001/geo/cma-rmr/def-eng.htm)).
