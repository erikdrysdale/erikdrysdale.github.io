This post replicates my [recently-posted](https://www.kaggle.com/erikinwest/incubation-pediatric) Kaggle notebook using the the [CORD-19](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) dataset which has more 37K full-text COVID-related articles. The goal of post is to show how to filter articles that are look for incubation period of the disease with the goal of finding a subset of articles that have a pediatric reference.

### Background

A wide variety of estimates of the incubation time have been seen in the rapidly evolving Covid-19 literature. As of March 27th, 2020 the most common number reported in the popular press appears to be the [5.2 day estimate](https://tinyurl.com/qnoccaj). While the variation in point estimates continues to be substantial, an average range of 5-6 days appears to be appropriate (for the mean). There has also been a limited discussion on the possibility of age-based differences in the incubation period. This kernel will go through the CORD-19 dataset and extract relevant sentences in regards to different moments of the the incubation period (mean, median, lower-bound, and upper-bound). At the end of the notebook, a subset of relevant papers that mention pediatric populations will be explored. As of now, there does not appear to be strong evidence for age related-difference in incubation periods.

Several technical notes.
1. The `df_txt.csv` load in the script below was generated with a similar method to xhlulu's [kernel](https://tinyurl.com/vdhlgl7).
2. A utility script is being used to help with the parsing. This can be found on [githib](https://github.com/ErikinBC/gists/blob/master/support_funs_incubation.py)
3. After the relevant sentences are found, a function `record_vals` is used to allow the user to **<u>manually</u>** select the sentences with "y(es)/n(o)"
4. I manually annotated the moments in the sentences


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os
import re

import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime as dt

from support_funs_incubation import stopifnot, uwords, idx_find, find_beside, ljoin, sentence_find, record_vals, color_printer

# load data
df = pd.read_csv('df_txt.csv')
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df.date)
print(df.shape)

# remove prefix from some abstracts: publically funded repositories.... etc
pref = 'COVID-19 resource centre remains active.'
for ii, aa in enumerate(df.abstract):
    if isinstance(aa, float):  # nan
        continue
    hit = re.search(pref, aa)
    if hit:
        df.abstract.iloc[ii] = aa[hit.span()[1] + 1:]
```
    (27936, 6)


## Section 1: Summary statistics

The code block below will calculate the number of 'covid' and 'nCoV' mentions in the texts and abstracts of the corpus. The first journal articles referencing 'covid' and 'nCoV' start on January 1st, 2020. The last relevant articles are around a week old as of March 27, 2020. The majority of articles use either 'Covid-2019' or '2019-nCoV', although there are some exceptions.


```python
# Find ways in which covid and ncov are referred to
regex_ncov = r'(20)?19(\-)?ncov|ncov(\-)?(20)?19'
regex_covid = r'covid(\-)?(20)?19'

# row indices
idx_covid_abs = np.where(idx_find(df.abstract, regex_covid))[0]
idx_ncov_abs = np.where(idx_find(df.abstract, regex_ncov))[0]
idx_union_abs = np.union1d(idx_covid_abs, idx_ncov_abs)

di_regex = {'covid': regex_covid, 'ncov': regex_ncov}
di_idx = {'covid': idx_covid_abs, 'ncov': idx_ncov_abs}

print('%i possible "covid" articles (using abstract)\n'
      '%i possible nCoV articles (using abstract)\n'
      'Union: %i, interection: %i' %
      (len(idx_covid_abs), len(idx_ncov_abs), len(idx_union_abs),
       len(np.intersect1d(idx_covid_abs, idx_ncov_abs))))

dfmt = '%B %d, %Y'
date_ncov_min = df.date.iloc[idx_ncov_abs].min().strftime(dfmt)
date_ncov_max = df.date.iloc[idx_ncov_abs].max().strftime(dfmt)
date_covid_min = df.date.iloc[idx_covid_abs].min().strftime(dfmt)
date_covid_max = df.date.iloc[idx_covid_abs].max().strftime(dfmt)

print('First and last nCoV article: %s & %s\n'
      'First and last covid-19 article: %s & %s' %
      (date_ncov_min, date_ncov_max, date_covid_min, date_covid_max))

holder = []
for term in di_regex:
    regex = di_regex[term]
    idx = di_idx[term]
    dat_abstract = uwords(df.abstract.iloc[idx], regex).assign(doc='abstract')
    dat_txt = uwords(df.txt.iloc[idx], regex).assign(doc='txt')
    dat = pd.concat([dat_abstract, dat_txt])
    dat = dat.groupby('term').n.sum().reset_index()
    dat.insert(0, 'tt', term)
    holder.append(dat)
df_term = pd.concat(holder).reset_index(drop=True)
# Term usage

## Section 2: Incubation period

To see how 'incubation' is being used in the corpus, it is useful to see the preceeding and succeeding word. While 'incubation period' is the most common expression, others such as 'incubation time' or 'incubation period' are in use too. 


```python
pat_peds = r'infant|child|pediatric|age\<'

idx_incubation = []
idx_peds = []
for ii in idx_union_abs:
    abs, txt = df.abstract[ii], df.txt[ii]
    corpus = abs + '. ' + txt
    if re.search(r'incubation', corpus, re.IGNORECASE) is not None:
        idx_incubation.append(ii)
    if re.search(pat_peds, corpus, re.IGNORECASE) is not None:
        idx_peds.append(ii)
idx_incubation_peds = np.intersect1d(idx_incubation, idx_peds)

print('%i incubation articles, with %i pediatric articles, %i overlap' %
      (len(idx_incubation), len(idx_peds), len(idx_incubation_peds)))

# What is the most common word to appear before/after incubation?
holder_l, holder_r = [], []
for ii in idx_incubation:
    abs, txt = df.abstract[ii], df.txt[ii]
    corpus = abs + '. ' + txt
    rterm = find_beside(corpus, 'incubation', tt='right')
    lterm = find_beside(corpus, 'incubation', tt='left')
    holder_r.append(rterm)
    holder_l.append(lterm)

dat_suffix = pd.Series(ljoin(holder_r)).str.lower().value_counts().reset_index().rename(
    columns={0: 'n', 'index': 'suffix'})
dat_prefix = pd.Series(ljoin(holder_l)).str.lower().value_counts().reset_index().rename(
    columns={0: 'n', 'index': 'prefix'})
print(pd.concat([dat_suffix.head(20),dat_prefix.head(20)],1))

suffix = ['period', 'time', 'distribution', 'duration', 'interval', 'rate', 'mean', 'median', 'estimation']
suffix = [z + r'(s)?' for z in suffix]
pat_incubation = [r'incubation\s'+z for z in suffix]
```

## Section 4: Manual curation

Now that a total of 194 articles have been found with relevant sentences, a manual curation will be performed to select which sentences are relevant and allow the user to annotate the data with the stated moments. Sentences were selected if they estimated an incubation period from actual data rather than used existing estimates.


```python
# Run sentence finder if output does not exist
do_run = 'sentence_flag.csv' not in os.listdir()
if do_run:
    keepers = []
    for jj, ii in enumerate(idx_incubation):
        abs, txt = df.abstract[ii], df.txt[ii]
        corpus = abs + '. ' + txt
        idx_sentences = sentence_find(corpus, pat_incubation)
        if len(idx_sentences) > 0:
            try:
                dd = df.loc[ii,'date'].strftime('%B %d, %Y')
            except:
                dd = 'NaN'
            print('</p><p>----- Title: %s, date: %s, index: %i (%i of %i) ----' %
                  (df.loc[ii, 'title'], dd , ii,jj+1,len(idx_incubation)))
            tmp = record_vals(idx_sentences)
            dat = pd.DataFrame(tmp,columns=['pos','txt']).assign(idx = ii)
            keepers.append(dat)
    dat_sentences = pd.concat(keepers)
    dat_sentences = dat_sentences[['idx','pos','txt']]
    dat_sentences['txt'] = dat_sentences.txt.str.replace('\n','')
    dat_sentences = df.iloc[idx_incubation][['source','title','doi','date']].rename_axis('idx').reset_index().merge(
                    dat_sentences,on='idx',how='right')
    dat_sentences.to_csv('sentence_flag.csv',index=False)
```

## Section 5: Analyze moments of incubation period

Load the manually annotated data with the added `moments` column.


```python
df_moments = pd.read_csv('sentence_flag.csv')
df_txt = df_moments[['title','pos','txt']].copy()
df_moments.drop(columns = ['pos','txt'],inplace=True)
df_moments['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_moments.date)
moments = df_moments.moments.str.split('\;',expand=True).reset_index().melt('index')
moments = moments[moments.value.notnull()].reset_index(drop=True).drop(columns='variable')
tmp = moments.value.str.split('\=',expand=True)
moments = moments.drop(columns='value').assign(moment=tmp.iloc[:,0], val=tmp.iloc[:,1].astype(float))
df_moments = df_moments.drop(columns='moments').reset_index().merge(moments,on='index',how='right').drop(columns='index')
# Print off key sentences
print('A total of %i unique studies' % (df_moments.title.unique().shape[0]) )
print('\n\n')
for ii, rr in df_txt.iterrows():
    print('</p><p>----- Article: %s -----' % rr['title'] )
    idx = [int(z) for z in re.findall(r'\d+', rr['pos'])]
    idx = np.array(idx).reshape([int(len(idx) / 2), 2])
    idx = [tuple(idx[i]) for i in range(idx.shape[0])]
    sentence = rr['txt']
    idx_sentence = (idx,sentence)
    color_printer(idx_sentence)
    print('\n')
```

As with the SARS-CoV, infections in <span style="color:red">child</span>ren appear to be rare.
No fatalities were reported in young <span style="color:red">child</span>ren and adolescents and fatal disease was reported in 6.8% of patients &lt; 60 years of age.
The mean <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> was estimated as 4.6 days with a range of 2 to 8 days between symptom onset and hospitalization.
Early symptoms of MERS include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, and malaise following a mean <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of 5 days, with a range of 2 to 13 days [23] .

Most of the infected individuals in Zhejiang province were male patients, but the age range of patients is large as SARS-Cov-2 also infected <span style="color:red">child</span>ren and those older than 65 years.
Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020.Main outcome measures Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, <span style="color:red">incubation period</span>.
The <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> was defined as the time from exposure to the onset of illness, which was estimated among patients who could provide the exact date of close contact with individuals from Wuhan with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection.
Among 56 patients who could provide the exact date of close contact with someone with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection, the median <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> from exposure to symptoms was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days).
Among the 33 patients who had symptoms for more than 10 days after illness onset, the median <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> from exposure to symptoms was 3 days (interquartile range 3-4 days).
It is possible that an even greater number of infected patients exist without a diagnosis because their symptoms were less severe and because of the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span>.

However, the incubation periods of the groups with age&gt;=40 years and <span style="color:red">age&lt;</span>40 years show a statistically significant difference.
To verify whether the incubation of the age&gt;=40 group is different from that of the <span style="color:red">age&lt;</span>40 group statistically, Figure 3 compares All rights reserved.
The Mann-Whitney rank test shows that there's a statistically significant difference between the incubation of <span style="color:red">age&lt;</span>40 and age&gt;=40 groups with the null hypothesis: the medians of incubation period between two groups are the same.
The p-values for corresponding alternative hypotheses: the <span style="color:red">age&lt;</span>40 group has a smaller incubation median is 0.00474.
It suggests that the <span style="color:red">age&lt;</span>40 group has a shorter incubation period than the age&gt;=40 group.
Data is partitioned as the age&gt;=40 and <span style="color:red">age&lt;</span>40 groups in visualization.

Our studies indicate that incubation periods of the age&gt;=40 years and <span style="color:red">age&lt;</span>40 years groups not only statistically significant but also linearly separable in machine learning.
Furthermore, different quarantine time should be applied to the age&gt;=40 years and <span style="color:red">age&lt;</span>40 years groups for their different incubation periods.
Accurate estimation of the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control.
However, it remains unclear about its exact <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure.
The accurate <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions.
In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions.
To achieve the accurate calculation of the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span>, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset.
Result: The <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions.
Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general <span style="color:red">incubation distributions</span> such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions.
We found that the <span style="color:red">incubation periods</span> of the groups with age&gt;=40 years and age&lt;40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference.
The former group had a longer <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> and a larger variance than the latter.
It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different <span style="color:red">incubation periods</span>.
It is essential to know the accurate <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of COVID-19 for the sake of deciphering dynamics of its spread.
The <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> is the time from infection to the onset of the disease.
Different viruses have different <span style="color:red">incubation periods</span> that determine their different dynamics epidemiologically.
The <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of H7N9 (Human Avian Influenza A) is about 6.5 days, but the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> for SARS-CoV is typically 2 to 7 days [5] [6] .
However, it remains unclear about its exact <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of COVID-19, although WHO estimates it is between 2 to 14 days after exposure [8] .

Furthermore, it is also unknown whether the <span style="color:red">incubation time</span> will show some statistically significant with respect to Age and Gender.
In this study, we aim to accurately estimate the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of COVID-19 by taking advantage of datasets with a well-documented history of exposure.
Our results show the <span style="color:red">incubation mean</span> and median of COVID-19 are 5.84 and 5.0 days respectively and there is a statistical significance with the role of gender.
However, the <span style="color:red">incubation periods</span> of the groups with age&gt;=40 years and age&lt;40 years show a statistically significant difference.
For those cases whose <span style="color:red">incubation periods</span> locate in an interval [ ! , " ],

The incubation will be calculated as = We propose a Monte Carlo simulation approach that takes advantage of bootstrap techniques to estimate <span style="color:red">incubation median</span> and mean estimation for the small sample with 59 cases.
It indicates that the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> median and mean of patients more than 40 years old are greater than those of patients less than 40 years old.
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027474 doi: medRxiv preprint The incubation of COVID-19 is not subject to neither of the widely used <span style="color:red">incubation distributions</span> such as normal, lognormal, Gamma, and Weibull distributions well [12] .
Although we can't reject Gamma distributions for its boundary line p-value (0.06086), it can be risky to use it to fit and estimate the distribution of the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> under a small sample size.
It suggests that that the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> is somewhat correlated with age though not that strong.

It indicates that the younger group tends to have a shorter <span style="color:red">incubation period</span>.
The variance of their <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> also seems to be smaller.
The Mann-Whitney rank test shows that there's a statistically significant difference between the incubation of age&lt;40 and age&gt;=40 groups with the null hypothesis: the medians of <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> between two groups are the same.
The p-values for corresponding alternative hypotheses: the age&lt;40 group has a smaller <span style="color:red">incubation median</span> is 0.00474.
It suggests that the age&lt;40 group has a shorter <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> than the age&gt;=40 group.
It suggests that COVID-19 could have a faster distribution speed than H7N9, but the same spread speed as SARS and MERS in terms of their <span style="color:red">incubation periods</span> [22] .
We also investigate the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of 12 family cases and 47 non-family cases in the dataset.
The Mann-Whitney rank test shows that there are not significant differences between family patients and non-family patients in terms of the median of <span style="color:red">incubation period</span>.
Our studies indicate that <span style="color:red">incubation periods</span> of the age&gt;=40 years and age&lt;40 years groups not only statistically significant but also linearly separable in machine learning.
It will be more interesting to estimate different <span style="color:red">incubation time</span> for them separately.
Furthermore, different quarantine time should be applied to the age&gt;=40 years and age&lt;40 years groups for their different <span style="color:red">incubation periods</span>.
Our ongoing work is to collect more qualified data to extend our existing results and investigate incubation of COVID-19 for different groups besides comparing our <span style="color:red">incubation estimation</span> with other studies [23] .

One case, a 6-month old male <span style="color:red">infant</span>, was asymptomatic until one spike of fever 2 days into hospital admission.
We reported the median (IQR) <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of SARS-CoV-2.
The median <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3–6).
To answer these questions, we report data for the first three clusters of COVID-19 cases in Singapore, the epidemi ological and clinical investigations done to ascertain disease characteristics and exposure types, and summary statistics to characterise the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the serial interval between trans mission pairs.
We reported the median (IQR) <span style="color:red">incubation period</span>, defined as the duration between estimated dates of infection and reported symptom onset, using R. We reported the serial interval range between transmission pairs in the household cluster.
The <span style="color:red">incubation periods</span> are plotted in figure 2 .
The median <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> was 4 days (IQR 3-6).
Other study limitations include the small sample size used to ascertain the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span>, because primary cases could not be identified with certainty.

</p><p>----- Title: Early epidemiological analysis of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak based on crowdsourced data: a population-level observational study, date: January 01, 2020 (36 of 38) ----
Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among <span style="color:red">child</span>ren.
Adjustment for the age demographics of China confirmed a deficit of infections among <span style="color:red">child</span>ren, with a RR below 0·5 in patients younger than 15 years (figure 1).
We found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups, with substantially fewer <span style="color:red">child</span>ren infected.
However, a substantial portion of the patients in our database are travellers, a population that is usually predominantly adults (although does not exclude <span style="color:red">child</span>ren).
Nevertheless, we would also expect <span style="color:red">child</span>ren younger than 5 years to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the healthcare system, as is seen for other respiratory infections.
A detailed analysis of one of the early COVID-19 clusters by Chan and colleagues 19 revealed symptomatic infections in five adult members of the same household, while a <span style="color:red">child</span> in the same household aged 10 years was infected but remained asymptomatic, potentially indicating biological differences in the risk of clinical disease driven by age.
Previous immunity from infection with a related coronavirus has been speculated to potentially protect <span style="color:red">child</span>ren from SARS, 20, 21 and so might also have a role in COVID-19.
Patient-level information is important to estimate key time-to-delay events (such as the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> and interval between symptom onset and visit to a hospital), analyse the age profile of infected patients, reconstruct epidemic curves by onset dates, and infer transmission parameters.
The estimated <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> in our data aligns with that of previous work.
We estimated the duration of the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> on the basis of our line list data.
The <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> was estimated as the midpoint between the time spent in Wuhan and the date of symptom onset.
On the basis of 33 patients with a travel history to Wuhan, we estimated the median <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> for COVID-19 to be 4·5 days (IQR 3·0-5·5; appendix p 2).
A useful feature of our crowdsourced database was the availability of travel histories for patients returning from Wuhan, which, along with dates of symptom onset, allowed for estimation of the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> here and in related work.
Several teams have used our dataset and datasets from others to estimate a mean <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> for COVID-19 to be 5-6 days (95% CI 2-11). [
13] [14] [15] [16] The <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> is a useful parameter to guide isolation and contact tracing; based on existing data, the disease status of a contact should be known with near certainty after a period of observation of 14 days.

CD8+ T cell exhaustion might be critical in the development of COVID-19.. Before 2002, 4 kinds of coronaviruses (CoVs, namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) were known to infect humans, causing 10%-30% mild upper respiratory infection in adults, occasionally severe pneumonia in elders, <span style="color:red">infant</span>s, and immunodeficient persons.
<span style="color:red">Incubation period</span> was calculated using the data of 31 cases with clear cutting time points of exposure and illness onset.
The mean <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> of COVID-19 was .
A previous study carried out in Wuhan indicated that the mean <span style="color:red">incubation period</span> was 5.2 days.
28 Finally, we characterized the epidemiological features including the <span style="color:red">incubation period</span>, time to RT-PCR conversion of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 course, and the transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers.

2. (Zhang et al 2020) [Clinical Characteristics of 34 Children with Coronavirus Disease-2019 in the West of China: a Multiple-center Case Series](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034686v1)
3. (Henry and Oliveira 2020) [Preliminary epidemiological analysis on children and adolescents with novel coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei Province, China: an observational study utilizing crowdsourced data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029884v2)

The first paper by (Han 2020) suggests that the incubation period is *shorter* for patients under the age of 40. The distribution of data points from Figure 3 of the paper appears to show a relatively short incubation period for those under 25. However there are only 59 patients in total for this study.

In (Zhang et al 2020) they suggest the opposite effect: the median incubation period of 10.5 days for pediatric patients, but only 4 for all age groups! However, this dataset also has a small sample size: 34. Lastly in (Henry and Oliveira 2020), the authors provide no new data to estimate the incubation period but instead reference [(Cai et al 2020)](https://tinyurl.com/s8gah4b) which estimates a median incubation period of 6.5 days with n=10.

Unfortunately the point estimates for the incubation period in the general population appears to quite noisy. Furthermore, there is contradictory evidence about whether there is an age-based discrepancy in the average or median incubation period. Therefore the evidence from the CORD-19 corpus appears to be that incubation period averages around 5-6 days, and that there is not sufficient evidence to reject a difference in moments between a pediatric and adult population with regards to incubation time.
