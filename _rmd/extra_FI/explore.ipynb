    "## (1) Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Most published studies have exagerated effect sizes. There are two main reasons for this. First, academic studies are under-powered. This means they do not have enough samples to be able to detect small effects. Second, academic journals incentivize researchers to publish \"novel\" findings that are statistically significant. In other words, researchers will continue to try different variations of statistical tests  until something \"interesting\" is found.[[^1]] These two phenenoma ensure that what gets reported is exagerated because large effect sizes are what is needed to publish. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the power of a statistical test defines the probability that an effect will be detected when it exists. Power is proportional to the sample size for [consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(statistics)) tests because more samples leads to tigher inference around some effect size. While most researchers are aware of the idea of statistical power, a much small share understand that it is also [directly related](http://www.erikdrysdale.com/winners_curse) to effect size bias. Conditional on statistical significance, all measured effect are biased upwards, because there  is a minimum effect size needed for a test to be considered statistically significant.[[^2]] Evidence that most fields of scientific literature are underpowered are numerous: from [meta-studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3475) to the [Proteus phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus_phenomenon). Many disciplines do not even require studies to make power justifications before research begins.[[^3]] \n",
    "\n",
    "One unfortunate reaction to the problem of low power is for researchers to carry out *post-hoc* (after-the-fact) power calculations, using the estimated effect size as the basis of the power calculations. This approach is highly problematic for three reasons. First, *post-hoc* power is [mathematically redundant](https://stat.uiowa.edu/sites/stat.uiowa.edu/files/techrep/tr378.pdf) since it has a one-to-one mapping with the conventially calculated p-value. Second, *post-hoc* power will always \"show\" high power for statistically significant results, and low power for statistically insiginicant results ([this post](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/why-ex-post-power-using-estimated-effect-sizes-bad-ex-post-mde-not) explains why).[[^X]] Lastly, in underpowered designs, the estimated effect will be extremely noisy, making *post-hoc* estimates of power [equally as noisy](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropower_final.pdf)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The *post-hoc* fragility index (FI) is relatively new statistical technique that uses an intuitive approach to quantify *post-hoc* statistical power in the case of a binary outcomes framework with two groups. Qualitatively, the FI states how many patients in the treatment group would need to have their status swapped from event to no-event in order for the trial to be statistically insignificant.[[^4]] Figure (1) below shows an example of a hypothetical study that has a FI of 3. Note, there are several technical nuances as to how to calculate the FI which are discussed below. The FI was first proposed in 2014 by [Walsh et. al (2014)](http://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fragility-index-2014.pdf), and calculated for RCTs published in high impact general medical journals. They found median FI of 8, and a 25% quantile of 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the original Walsh paper, the FI has been applied hundreds of times to other branches of the (mainly) medical literature.[[^5]] Most branches of medical literature show a median FI that is in the single digits. While the FI has its drawbacks (discussed below), this new approach appears to have captured the statistical imagination of researchers in a way that power calculations have not. While being told that a study has 20% power should cause immediate consternation, it apparently does not cause the same level of dismay as founding out an important cancer drug RCT was two coding errors away from being deemed ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this post is organized as follows: section (2) provides a technical definition of the FI and the different approaches in how to calculate it using `python` code, section (3) describes the relationship between the FI an other statistical quantities, section (4) reviews the criticisms against FI, and section (5) concludes."

    "## (2) Calculating the fragility index\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the classical statistical scenario of a 2x2 table of outcomes, corresponding to two different groups with a binary outcome recorded for each group. For example, a randomized control trial (RCT) for a medical intervention usually corresponds to this scenario where the two groups are the (randomized) treatment and control group and the study records some event indicator associated with a health outcome. Suppose in this trial that the event rate is greater in treatment than the control group, and that this positive difference is statistically significant. There are two ways for the data to minimally altered, whilst keeping the sample sizes or both groups fixed (denoted $n_1$ and $n_2$ below), so that the test statistic will yield a statistically insignificant result. The first approach is to swap patients from the event to the non-event category in group 1, this reduces the event rate in group 1 closer to group 2 (this is what is done in the [original methodology](http://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fragility-index-2014.pdf)). The second approach is to increase the event rate in group 2 by swapping patients from a non-event to an event category.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section we'll use examine the distribution of the FI when the test statistic is the normal-approximation of a difference in a binomial proportion, what is hereafter referred to as the binomial proportion fragility index (BPFI). While Fisher's exact or chi-squared tests are usually used for estimating the FI from contingency tables, the BPFI is easier to study because it has an analytic solution. Two other simplifications will be used to allow for simpler analysis: the sample sizes will be the same between groups and a one-sided hypothesis test will be used. Even though the BPFI may not be standard, it is a consistent statistic that is [asymptotically normal](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2579383/proof-of-binomial-distribution-asymptotic-to-normal-distribution) and just as valid as using a chi-squared test. \n",

    "## (2) Criticisms of post-hoc fragility\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the FI first made a big splash, there are three main strands of criticism I've seen against it. I describe each three in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, and most technically sophisticated, argument made by [Potter (2019)]((https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32781488/)) is that FI is comparable between studies and does not actually do what it claims to do: quantify how \"fragile\" the result of a study is. Specifically, the FI does not quantify how likely the null hypothesis is (i.e. that there is no effect). If there are two statistically significant trials that have the same p-value, but differ in sample size, then it must be the case the trial with a smaller sample size has a larger effect. By looking at the [Bayes factor](), it can be shown that for any choice of prior, a small trial with a larger effect size is more indicative of an effect existing.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{a}{b}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Therefore, if the probability model is correct (as in the coin toss example), the small trial provides more evidence for the alternative hypothesis than the large one. It should not be penalized for using fewer events to demonstrate significance. When the probability model holds, the FI incorrectly concludes that the larger trial provides stronger evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a study with 100 patients might have a p-value of 1e-6 and a FI of 5, whereas a study with 1000 patients with a p-value of 0.03 might have a FI of 10. In other words, the FI tends to penalize studies for being small, rather than studies that have a weak signal. Second, the fragility index will oftentimes come to the opposite conclusion of a [Bayes factor] analysis. As  puts it:\n",
    "\n",
    "> By calculating the posterior probability of a treatment effect, we show that when the probability model is correct, the FI inappropriately penalizes small trials for using fewer events than larger trials to achieve the same significance level... Altogether, the FI creates more confusion than it resolves and does not promote statistical thinking. We recommend against its use. Instead, sensitivity analyses are recommended to quantify and communicate robustness of trial results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporters of the FI would push back as follows: first, a simple way to make the FI comparable between studies is to use the fragility quotient (FQ), which divides the FI by either the sample size or the number of events (on both arms). Second, smaller studies should naturally be penalized in a frequentist paradigm, not because their alternative hypothesis are less likely to be true (which is what the Bayes factor tells us), but rather because the point estimate of the statistic conditional on significance is going to be exagerated. In other words, smaller studies have less power which have a larger effect size bias (I've provided explicit formulas for this [here](http://www.erikdrysdale.com/winners_curse/)). "

    "## (X) Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As Perry Wilson [points out](https://www.methodsman.com/blog/fragility-index), the FI is really just another to critisize the use of dichotomous thinking when it comes to doing statistical evidence. If you flip a coin 100 times, and 60 of them are heads, and you use the usual 5% p-value cut-off, you will reject a null of an unbiased coin (p-value=0.045). But such a result has a FI of one, since 59 heads would have a p-value of 0.07. However, both results are \"unlikely\" under the null, so it seems stange to conclude the the initial finding should be discretided because of an FI of one. I think Wilson's point is right, but more for the broader problem it suggests. If the world's scientists went around flipping every coin they found lying on the side walk 100 times and then submitting \"findings\" to journals every time they got 60/40 or more/less heads, the world would appear to be festooned with biased coins. The bigger problem is that it's a silly hypothesis to test initially, and even if there are biased coins, the effect is probably very slight (50.1%) but the observed biases would be at least ±10% more extreme than what should be reported. This highlights the bigger problem of [scientific research](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/pvalues3.pdf) and the file drawer problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because low power is not commmonly understood to be a problem in terms of effect sizes and reproducability, researchers have developed all sorts of mental ju-jitsu techniques to defend their weak studies. Such techniques include the \"whatever doesn't kill my p-value makes it stronger\" [argument](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/02/06/not-kill-statistical-significance-makes-stronger-fallacy/).[[^6]] Not to pick on [Justin Wolfers](https://www.econtalk.org/stevenson-and-wolfers-on-happiness-growth-and-the-reinhart-rogoff-controversy/#audio-highlights), but here is one example of such a sentiment:\n",

So it's amazing that the estimated correlation is as high as 0.8, given that I'm finding that's a correlation between two noisy measures. \n",
