    "Consider the sum of a normal $Z_1 \\sim N(\\mu_1,\\tau_1^2)$ and truncated normal variable and $Z_2 \\sim TN(\\mu_2,\\tau_2^2,a,b)$: $W=Z_1+Z_2$. How can this normal-truncated sum (NTS) distribution be characterized? One approach for doing inference on $W$ is simply to sample from it, as sampling algorithms for both $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are well defind. Having an analytical formula for the density (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for $W$ allows for an exact calculations which can enable faster inference over a range of different parameters and removes the randomness inherant in sampling. This post will show how to 1) calculate the PDF and CDF for $W$, and 2) provide three statistical use cases: i) quality control, ii) two-stage hypothesis testing, and iii) data carving for selective inference. \n",

    "The CDF of a bivarate normal will turn out to be necessary to calculate the CDF of the NTS. While there is no closed-form solution to the CDF of a BVN (unless it's to calculate the the CDF from the origin), the integration problem can be written fairly succinctly and solved by fast integration solvers. Furthermore, there are analytical solutions an approximation of the CDF. This section will briefly review both approaches. \n",
