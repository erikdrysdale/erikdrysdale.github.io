    "Consider the sum of a normal $Z_1 \\sim N(\\mu_1,\\tau_1^2)$ and a truncated normal $Z_2 \\sim TN(\\mu_2,\\tau_2^2,a,b)$, denoted $W=Z_1+Z_2$. How can this normal-truncated sum (NTS) distribution be characterized? One approach for doing inference on $W$ would be to simply sample from $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, as can be done with most statistical software. However, having an analytical or numerical method for calculating the density (PDF) and cumulative distribution (CDF) of $W$ has several benefits over the sampling approach. This includes including vectorization, reproducibility across software programs, and faster compute times (especially for the tails of the distribution). This post will provide `python` code to calculate the PDF and CDF of an arbitrary NTS. The value of distribution will be highlighted with three use cases: i) quality control, ii) two-stage hypothesis testing, and iii) data carving for selective inference. \n",

Sections (2) and (3) are not original work, but instead show how to translate these research papers into usable code. In section (4), the two-stage hypothesis testing and data carving are original contributions in making the connection between these statistical problems and the NTS distribution. "

This section will briefly review both approaches. \n",

    "## (4.C) Application: Data carving\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical instruments of statistical inference like p-values and confidence internals have probabilistic properties whose validity relies on an *a priori* specification of the model and null hypotheses. Which variables will be tested and through which model must be determined independent of any data. In the age of exploratory statistics and large datasets these assumptions are increasingly at odds with empirical practice. For example, researchers who use a [lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) model to find a sparse set of coefficients will often \"investigate\" the importance of the features by examining the frequency of which variables get selected through bootstrapping or cross-validation.[[^5]] Unfortunately, the traditional methods of doing inference on the coefficients of a regression model do not work for the lasso because which coefficients get selected is a function of the data. In other words, both the model and the null hypothesis is determined *ex post* rather than *a priori*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the framework of Fithian, Sun, and Taylor (see [*Optimal Inference After Model Selection*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2597)), obtaining valid inference in the adaptive selection paradigm requires a two-stage process: \"1) the **selection stage** determines what questions to ask, and 2) the **inference stage** answers those questions.\" Specifically, we are interested in \"selective validity\", that is obtaining the right level of a test conditional on selection process. \n",
    "\n",
    "For multiple regression or multiple comparisons tests, selection usually amounts to restricting hypothesis testing to parameters that exceed some value. For example, in genetics, we may only want to examine genes whose association with a phenotype has a z-score (in absolute value) greater than 2. In the case of the lasso, we want to obtain confidence intervals for the features with non-zero coefficients in the model. When the distribution of these test statistics is Gaussian, then conditioning on the selection event usually leads to a truncated Gaussian distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three statistical approaches that yield selective validity include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data splitting \n",
    "2. Select inference\n",
    "3. Data carving\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of using a portion of the data to come up with hypotheses, and then another portion to carry out inference, has been an accepted practice amongst statisticians for decades (see [Cox (1975)](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/62/2/441/337164?redirectedFrom=PDF)). If data splitting is done properly, then its inferences must be valid in the classical sense because the unused portion of the data is truly independent. The downside of data splitting is twofold. First, it suffers from a \"p-value lottery\", so that the results will vary depending on which random seed is used. Second, the portion of the data that is used for selection will contain unused statistical information that needs to be discarded. For example, suppose the selection procedure only selects parameters that have a z-score greater than 0.01 for second-stage inference. Under the null of no effect, this will discard less than 1% of hypotheses, which means that the selection procedure is effectively meaningless. But for the inference in stage two to be valid, this portion of the dataset needs to be discarded regardless. In other words, the amount of residual statistical information leftover from the selection stage will be inversely proportional to the stringency of the selection procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The selective inference approach conditions on the selection event and then does inference on the \"remaining\" portion of the statistical information. Nevertheless, there is an inherent selection-inference trade-off between data splitting and selective-inference, with the latter finding more interesting models/hypotheses but at the expense of lower power. A middle-ground between data splitting and selective inference is data carving, which carries out inference with a combination of an unused portion of the data as well as the remaining information from the data that was already used for selective inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data carving will necessarily have a higher power than selective inference because the unused portion of the data does not need to be conditioned on. However, selective inference is more likely to find  interesting hypotheses because the entire dataset is used during the selection stage. When deciding how much data to set aside to inference, the researcher must balance the need for power versus selection. Selective inference is the case of data carving when the fraction of unused data approach zero. However data carving always dominates data splitting for the same fraction of data used for the inference stage because data carving throws away only the statistical information implied by the selection procedure on the selection stage, whereas data splitting completely discards the information."

In each simulation the true coefficients will be zero, so that we can see the distribution of the estimator under a null hypothesis of no effect. We should expect that CIs will cover the true mean (zero) 95% of the time, and the p-values will be less than 0.05, 5% of the time. Because only 1000 simulations are run, there will still be some variations in the coverage/rejection probabilities, but these should be within normal measurement error of their targets."
