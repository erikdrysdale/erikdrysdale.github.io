1) Set up the Gemfile
——
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"

gem "minima", "~> 2.5.1"
gem "rouge", "~> 3.26.0"

gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
———

2) bundle install

3) bundle update

4) bundle exec jekyll serve

5) Issues I've noticed: there might be different versions of ruby. I had to set export 
GEM_HOME=~/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.1.0 in the bash_profile, find and delete the other versions of ruby, add copy 
the ruby/bin to the /usr/local/bin
